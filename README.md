# calculator
Project: Calculator from TheOdinProject
This is the last project of the Foundations course of The Odin Project. This project was the most complex out of all. Working on this project showed me the importance of breaking down problems into smaller subproblems. I think what really helped me get this calculator to work was the fact that I focused on one functionality at a time. And build from there.

The coolest thing I added in this project was creating a shadow effect that makes it look like the buttons are being pressed. The setTimeOut built-in function came in handy as it deactivates the shadow effect after a delay. The most difficult function I worked on were the operator buttons. I had to take into account the 5 different possible scenarios - 1. If the screen is empty, 2. If the screen says "can't divide by 0", 3. If there's only one operand, 4. If there's two operands. 5, If you want to switch between operator modes.
